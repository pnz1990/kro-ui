## What the RGD Designer covers

The RGD Designer is the authoring surface for creating and editing ResourceGroupDefinitions:
the /author route, the generate form, YAML preview, CEL/schema editing, validation, and the
optimization advisor. It is the primary tool for developers creating new kro workloads.

---

## Present (✅)

- ✅ RGD YAML generator: instance form, batch mode, YAML preview (PR #144, 2026-04)
- ✅ Generate form polish: required field indicator, aria-required (PR #144, 2026-04)
- ✅ RGD Designer nav: /author promoted to nav, New RGD mode removed, live DAG preview (PR #206, 2026-04)
- ✅ Global /author route + New RGD top bar entrypoint (PR #181, 2026-04)
- ✅ RGD Designer full feature coverage: all 5 node types, includeWhen, readyWhen CEL, schema field editor (PR #144, 2026-04)
- ✅ RGD Designer YAML validation, editable YAML panel, expanded optimization advisor (PR #273, 2026-04)
- ✅ forEach collapse suggestions in catalog (optimization advisor) (PR #78, 2026-04)
- ✅ CEL highlighter: pure TS kro CEL/schema tokenizer (PR #34, 2026-04)
- ✅ RGD validation linting: surface validation conditions in the UI (PR #50, 2026-04)
- ✅ Designer: import existing RGD from cluster (load from live cluster → editable form) (issue #542, 2026-04)
- ✅ E2E journey for Designer cluster import panel: Playwright journey 082 covers toggle open, RGD list population, select + Load, form state replacement (issue #619, 2026-04)

## Future (🔲)

- ✅ Designer: node library — click-to-add from common resource templates (NodeLibrary component, GH #543)
- ✅ Designer: collaboration mode — share designer URL with readonly view (DesignerShareButton + DesignerReadonlyBanner, GH #544)
- ✅ Designer axe-core coverage: journey 074 Step 7 runs WCAG 2.1 AA blocking axe-core assertion on `/author`; tab bar (role=tablist/tab, aria-selected), form inputs, and interactive elements are all in scope; SVG excluded as complex widget; upgraded from non-blocking to blocking in PR #689 (issue #683, 2026-04)
- ✅ Designer: `localStorage` persistence of in-progress RGD draft — auto-save (debounced 2s) to `kro-ui-designer-draft` key; "Restore draft?" banner on next visit with Restore/Discard actions; disabled in readonly/shared-URL mode (PR #647, 2026-04)
- ✅ Designer tab focus restoration: tab bar with Schema/Resources/YAML/Preview tabs; active tab and selected DAG node persisted to `sessionStorage` (`kro-ui-designer-tab-state`) so navigating away and returning restores last working context; readonly/shared-URL mode is excluded from persistence (issue #684, 2026-04)

- 🔲 Designer: apply-to-cluster action — the Designer currently generates YAML for manual `kubectl apply` by the user; a user who is already authenticated (kubeconfig loaded, kro-ui running) must context-switch to a terminal to apply; add a "Apply to cluster" button in the Designer YAML preview that POSTs the generated RGD YAML to a new `POST /api/v1/rgds` endpoint; the backend uses the dynamic client's `Apply` (server-side apply) with field manager `kro-ui`; the endpoint MUST validate the YAML against the RGD CRD schema before applying and return structured errors; this is the only mutating API kro-ui would ever have — it must be explicitly gated behind a `canApplyRGDs` capability flag that defaults to false and requires explicit opt-in in a future release; adding the design item now ensures the architecture decision (SSA vs create/replace, error surface, capability gate) is reviewed before any implementation starts (2026-04)
- 🔲 Designer: import-from-cluster — a user authoring a new RGD often wants to start from an existing one; they must currently copy-paste YAML from the RGD detail YAML tab into the Designer; add an "Import from cluster" button that opens a searchable RGD picker (using the existing `/api/v1/rgds` endpoint), selects an RGD, and loads its `spec` into the Designer as the starting point; the loaded RGD is clearly labeled "imported — editing local copy" to prevent confusion with the live cluster version; this closes the round-trip gap: the Designer can create RGDs but cannot learn from existing ones without manual steps (2026-04)

---

## Zone 1 — Obligations

**O1**: Designer MUST validate RGD YAML before showing an apply/export button — invalid YAML must block submission.
**O2**: CEL expressions MUST be highlighted with the kro-specific tokenizer — not generic YAML highlighting.
**O3**: The live DAG preview MUST update within 2s of schema changes without a page reload.

---

## Zone 2 — Implementer's judgment

- YAML editor: CodeMirror with kro CEL extension is the established choice; do not replace without benchmarking.
- Optimization advisor: suggestion thresholds (e.g. forEach collapse at N resources) are configurable via feature flags.

---

## Zone 3 — Scoped out

- Server-side RGD template storage (browser-local only for now)
- AI-assisted YAML generation (deferred — no LLM integration in kro-ui)
