# Specification Quality Checklist: RGD List Virtualization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- FR-010 explicitly calls out the constitution amendment, ensuring the doc update
  is tracked as a deliverable alongside the code changes.
- Assumptions section documents the uniform-card-height dependency — this is the
  only area where implementation choices could affect scope (variable-height cards
  would require a different virtualization approach).
